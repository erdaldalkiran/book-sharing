# 1. registration with email

Date: 2017-04-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

should we give the users option of registering to the system with their emails.

## Decision

nope. we don't want to keep users' email addresses and passwords. nowdays, a typical internet user is a member of one of the popular social platforms and these social platforms have better security measures than us. we're gonna provide facebook, twitter, linkedin and github login options to the users.

## Consequences

we may lose some of the users who don't prefer to be a member of a social platform. on the other hand, not storing user credentials will reduce the development time and increase the reliablity of the system.
